I've provided the pdf below, as well as two other of my published papers (under 8 pages each), as well as my Master's Thesis on Automatic Melodic Analysis (not under 8 pages)\r\n* [Automatic Melodic Reduction Using a Supervised Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar](https://github.com/bigpianist/bigpianist.github.io/blob/master/ISMIR2016Final.pdf) (Award-winning Paper)\r\n* [Finding Optimal Triadic Transformational Spaces Using Dijkstra's Shortest-Path Algorithm](https://github.com/bigpianist/bigpianist.github.io/blob/master/MCMSubmission.pdf)\r\n* [Automatic Harmonization Using a Hidden semi-Markov Model](https://github.com/bigpianist/bigpianist.github.io/blob/master/AutomaticHarmonizationHSMM.pdf)\r\n* [Master's Thesis: Automatic Melodic Analysis](https://github.com/bigpianist/bigpianist.github.io/blob/master/RGThesis_Final.pdf)\r\n\r\n## App Development\r\nContributed to the release of two music-making apps: Zya, and Ditty. \r\n### Zya\r\nZya was an automated music composition app that allowed anyone to create new music from scratch, or mix and match with stems from famous artists. The system handled vocal transcription, key signature detection, pitch-tuning and correction, automatic harmonization, dynamic transposition and arrangement of MIDI patterns, cloud-based rendering and streaming, and automatic mixing and mastering. I was personally involved or driving every one of those research projects. Here is [a demo of how Zya worked.](https://vimeo.com/70802572)\r\n\r\n### Ditty\r\nDitty was our 2nd music app, in a push to streamline the creation process even more. For Ditty, I was the Director of Research and Development, and was solely responsible for the musical engine which took a user's text, broke down the grammatical and phrase structure, segmented melodic phrases of the chosen song, aligned the user's text to the melody using optional melismas or melodic embellishments, synthesized the vocals and streamed it down to the device. You can still see what people are currently creating with Ditty through the [#ditty](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ditty&src=typd) search on Twitter. Ditty won the Best Music App award for 2015 through the Appy Awards, and currently has over 5 million users.\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of the different possible alignments given different text lengths. The first repeats a textual phrase, the 2nd extends individual notes, and the third inserts notes to manage a longer text.\r\n* [Example of repeated text](https://youtu.be/JNDajI7T8gw)\r\n* [Example of melismas](https://youtu.be/nMmpBVR8j0M)\r\n* [Example of inserted notes](https://youtu.be/JxuxqnOtS4w)\r\n\r\n## Composition / Recording & Production Examples\r\nI've recorded two independent albums of my own compositions, performed by various artists including myself. In all these songs, I am the singer, and I play all the piano parts, and the rhythm (non-lead) guitar parts. I produced each album as well. \r\n\r\n### New Album\r\n* [Upright](https://soundcloud.com/ryangroves/upright-1/s-OpMfR)\r\n* [Supertramp](https://soundcloud.com/ryangroves/supertramp/s-Hht8K)\r\n* [Drive](https://soundcloud.com/ryangroves/drive/s-Zlb7K)\r\n* [I'm Sorry](https://soundcloud.com/ryangroves/im-sorry-1/s-8XFVd)\r\n* [Middle Man](https://soundcloud.com/ryangroves/middle-man/s-rvOs1)\r\n\r\n### First Album, Cherry by The Twisted Limbs\r\n* [Bandcamp link to Album](http://ryangroves.bandcamp.com/)\r\n\r\n## Patents\r\nThrough my industry work, I've been able to file multiple patents with my original work\r\n* For my work on Ditty: \r\n * [System and Method for Automatically Converting Textual Messages to Musical Composition](http://1.usa.gov/1Xs3JGp)\r\n* For my work on automatic chord progression generation:\r\n * [System and method for producing a more harmonious musical accompaniment](http://1.usa.gov/1pTMrxa)\r\n* For my work on detecting key signatures from musical audio: \r\n * [System and method for producing a more harmonious musical accompaniment](http://1.usa.gov/1pTMrxa)\r\n* For my work on melody correction:\r\n * [System and method for conforming an audio input to a musical key](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220140053710%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20140053710&RS=DN/20140053710)\r\n* For my work on a sampling system for pre-recorded vocal melodies:\r\n * [System and Method for Enhancing Audio](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220140140536%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20140140536&RS=DN/20140140536)",
